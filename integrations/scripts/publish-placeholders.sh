# Reserve 0.0.1 placeholder releases for the xberg npm integration packages.
#
# Purpose: reserve each scoped name and configure its npm trusted publisher
# BEFORE the functional package (version-locked to xberg) ships via CI.
#
# Run this yourself — `npm publish` needs an interactive `npm login` and 2FA/OTP
# which a headless agent can't provide. Each placeholder is built in a temp dir,
# so the real package sources are never published.
#
# Usage:
#   npm login                                                   # if not authenticated
#   integrations/scripts/publish-placeholders.sh                # all packages
#   integrations/scripts/publish-placeholders.sh @xberg-io/langchain-xberg   # one
# ~keep

VERSION="0.0.1"
