//! Single-slot, fingerprinted crawl-engine memo on [`super::EngineInner`].
//!
//! Multi-URL batch extraction routes every URL that shares the batch's base
//! crawl configuration through ONE [`crawlberg::CrawlEngine`], so the engine's
//! shared middleware chain, cache, and rate-limiter are reused across the
//! whole batch. The engine is keyed by a stable fingerprint of its
//! [`crawlberg::CrawlConfig`]: when the incoming config fingerprint matches the
//! memoized one the cached engine is cloned (it is `Arc`-backed and cheap to
//! clone), otherwise a fresh engine is validated, built, stored, and returned.
//!
//! This module is engine-internal and not part of the binding surface.
